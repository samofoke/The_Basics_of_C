Data type determines the set of values that a data item can take and the operations
that can be performed on the item.
C language provides four basic data types. Table 1.2 lists the data types,
their size, range, and usage for a C programmer.
The char data type is of one byte and is used to store single characters.
Note that C does not provide any data type for storing text.

might have been surprised to see that the range of char is given as –128 to 127.
char is supposed to store characters not numbers, so why this range? The answer is
that in the memory, characters are stored in their ASCII codes.
For example, the character ‘A’ has the ASCII code of 65. 
In memory we will not store ‘A’ but 65 (in binary number format).

char  (n size byte)1  ((range) –128 to 127) To store characters.
int	  (n size byte)2  ((range) –32768 to 32767) To store integer numbers.

While the smaller data types take less memory, the larger data types incur a performance penalty. 
Although the data type we use for our variables does not have a big impact on the speed or memory
usage of the application, we should always try to use int unless there is a need to use any other data type.

Declaring Variables
To declare a variable, specify the data type of the variable followed by its name. 
The data type indicates the kind of values that the variable can store.
Variable names should always be meaningful and must reflect the purpose of their usage in the program. 
In C, variable declaration always ends with a semi-colon. For example,
           int emp_num;
           float salary;
           char grade;
           double balance_amount;
           unsigned short int acc_no;
In C, variables can be declared at any place in the program but two things must be kept in mind. 
First, variables should be declared before using them. Second, variables should be declared closest 
to their first point of use so that the source code is easier to maintain.

Initializing Variables
While declaring the variables, we can also initialize them with some value. For example,
           int emp_num = 7;
           float salary = 9800.99
           char grade = ‘A’;
           double balance_amount = 100000000;
Constants
Constants are identifiers whose values do not change. While values of variables can be changed at any time, 
values of constants can never be changed. Constants are used to define fixed values like pi or the charge 
on an electron so that their value does not get changed in the program even by mistake.
Declaring Constants
To declare a constant, precede the normal variable declaration with const keyword and assign it a value.
           const float pi = 3.14;
